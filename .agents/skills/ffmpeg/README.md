# FFmpeg Expert Skill

A practical FFmpeg skill for inspecting local media, planning reviewable video or podcast edits, rendering safely, and accepting outputs from evidence rather than command success alone.

## Why Install This Skill

FFmpeg failures often happen at boundaries: the wrong stream is selected, a cut lands on an unexpected keyframe, a filter is absent from the installed build, timestamps drift, or a technically valid output fails in its real destination. Editorial work adds another risk: sparse frames, silence intervals, and imperfect transcripts can look more conclusive than they are.

This skill provides a repeatable intake-to-acceptance workflow. It separates technical measurements from editorial judgment, preserves originals, makes cuts reviewable in an edit decision list, and records what was actually checked.

## Quick Start

Install FFmpeg with your platform package manager and inspect the source before choosing an edit:

```sh
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
ffprobe -v error -show_format -show_streams -of json input.mp4
```

For a media editing task:

1. Copy `templates/media-intake.json` into a private task workspace and record the source and output contract.
2. Collect only the bounded frame, clip, transcript, or signal evidence needed for the decision.
3. Copy `templates/edit-decision-list.json` or `templates/podcast-edit-plan.md` and review consequential cuts.
4. Render to a new path with overwrite refusal while exploring.
5. Copy `templates/media-acceptance-report.md`, probe and review the result, then test the intended player, editor, service, or archive boundary.

Before using a version-sensitive recipe, inspect the local capability:

```sh
scripts/ffmpeg-preflight --filter scale --filter loudnorm --encoder libx264 --hwaccel videotoolbox
```

Named checks report each capability as present or absent. Exit code `1` means a required tool/probe failed; `2` means a requested capability is absent from a usable inventory. Add `--json` for machine-readable output.

Run the complete synthetic integration example in a new or empty task-local directory:

```sh
scripts/editorial-workflow-example /tmp/ffmpeg-editorial-example --json
```

The resulting acceptance report passes only the exercised component and integration checks; semantic, listening, and downstream-consumer boundaries remain explicitly unverified.

Generate the richer real-media test battery when a change needs timestamp, concat, audio, subtitle, or bounded visual evidence:

```sh
scripts/generate-media-fixtures /tmp/ffmpeg-fixtures --json
```

Generated media remains task-local; commit the generator and test assertions, not the binary outputs.

Produce measured audio evidence and a reviewable plan without changing the source:

```sh
scripts/audio-inspect input.wav \
  --measure-silence --silence-threshold=-45dB --silence-duration 0.7 \
  --measure-loudness --measure-clipping --json
```

Optional timed transcript JSON must disclose alignment quality. Detector intervals and transcript ranges remain candidates until listening review approves an edit.

Evaluate a rendered output against declared criteria:

```sh
scripts/media-verify acceptance-contract.json output-probe.json \
  --evidence review-evidence.json --json
```

Missing fields or review evidence remain `UNVERIFIED`; blocked reviews remain `BLOCKED`; local probe/decode success never supplies downstream compatibility evidence.

Prepare visual evidence around proposed edit boundaries without exposing the source path:

```sh
ffmpeg/scripts/vision-review-handoff private.mov --asset-id asset-017 \
  --question "Does the sampled boundary preserve title continuity?" \
  --timestamp 12.4 --neighbor-seconds 0.25 --output-dir review-packet --json
```

The manifest covers only its listed samples. An authorized reviewer must add attributed observations before `import-vision-review` can link them to an EDL; sparse frames never prove absence throughout a video.

For destination-specific delivery, evaluate a sourced target contract and preserve target evidence separately:

```sh
ffmpeg/scripts/target-compatibility target.json output-probe.json \
  --target-evidence target-result.json --json
```

The verdict applies only to the named target and version. A local FFmpeg decode pass does not substitute for import, playback, or ingest evidence from that consumer.

## Triggers

Load this skill for:

- Media intake, FFprobe manifests, stream/container/timestamp inspection, or output contracts
- Remuxing, transcoding, filtering, trimming, joining, extraction, subtitles, or synchronization
- Bounded review-frame or audio-evidence preparation from supplied/authorized local media
- Transcript-assisted video edits, reviewable EDLs, or deterministic render plans
- Podcast cutting, silence/noise analysis, loudness measurement, and audio cleanup
- Build capability checks, overwrite-safe batch work, output verification, or failure diagnosis

Use another capability first for online media/transcript acquisition, semantic image interpretation, HTML-authored HyperFrames composition, platform publishing/API work, DRM, or rights clearance.

## Requirements

- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` on `PATH` for execution
- A shell with careful filename and filter-expression quoting
- A vision-capable or human reviewer for semantic claims about extracted images
- Listening playback for editorial audio acceptance
- Network access only for linked documentation or an explicitly requested network protocol
- Hardware acceleration only with the relevant device, drivers, compiled support, and a verified end-to-end path
