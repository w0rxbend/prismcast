# Advanced Operations and Safety

## Hardware acceleration is a pipeline decision

Hardware acceleration may affect decoding, filtering, and encoding separately. A hardware encoder alone does not guarantee faster end-to-end processing. Transfers between system memory and device memory can erase gains, and hardware encoders can have different quality, feature, and rate-control behavior from software encoders.

First inspect the local build:

```sh
ffmpeg -hwaccels
ffmpeg -encoders
ffmpeg -filters | grep -E 'cuda|vaapi|qsv|videotoolbox|vulkan'
```

The recorded local macOS build (see `local-verification.md`) lists `videotoolbox`. NVIDIA CUDA examples from the vendor guide do not transfer to other platforms. Verify the exact device, pixel formats, filter path, and encoder on the target build before benchmarking.

## Timestamp and synchronization diagnosis

When audio drifts, video freezes, concat jumps, or duration is wrong, collect:

```sh
ffprobe -v error -show_streams -show_format -of json input
ffmpeg -loglevel verbose -i input -f null -
```

Compare stream start times, durations, time bases, frame rates, sample rates, packet ordering, and whether a muxer is buffering sparse streams. Avoid cargo-culting timestamp flags. Options such as `-start_at_zero`, `-copyts`, `-vsync`/the modern synchronization controls, `setpts`, `asetpts`, `aresample`, and `avoid_negative_ts` solve different problems and can interact.

### Audio drift: diagnose before adjusting

Audio drift (gradually increasing A/V offset, or audio that ends before/after video) is a timing or rate mismatch, not a volume problem. Diagnose in this order:

1. **Probe both streams.** Compare `start_time`, `duration`, `time_base`, `sample_rate`, and codec with `ffprobe`. A nonzero or mismatched `start_time` between audio and video shifts the whole track; different `sample_rate` or a rate-labeling mismatch causes progressive drift.
2. **Check the operation history.** Concatenating sources with different sample rates or time bases, trimming without `asetpts`, or re-encoding AAC (encoder delay/priming samples) each produce characteristic offset patterns. AAC priming shifts audio by a fixed amount; rate mismatch grows over time.
3. **Normalize deliberately.** `aresample=async=1:first_pts=0` resamples and stretches/squeezes audio onto the video clock, compensating small drift; `asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS` resets timestamps after trimming or concat; `aformat` plus an explicit `sample_rate` makes both inputs share one rate before joining. Apply these where the mismatch originates rather than at the final output only.

If drift appears only in a specific player or receiver, verify the container edit lists and stream timestamps there before changing the encode; the muxer may be preserving an offset the encoder did not create.

## Reproducible experiments

Pin the binary version, record `ffmpeg -version` and `-buildconf`, preserve the exact input or synthetic generator, and probe both sides. Run more than once when measuring speed. Separate wall-clock throughput from output quality and compatibility. If a tutorial omits hardware, build, driver, codec settings, or measurement method, treat its performance claim as incomplete.

## Security and operational boundaries

Do not feed untrusted media to an experimental decoder or enable permissive protocol behavior without understanding the exposure. Avoid secrets in command-line arguments when process listings or logs can expose them. Restrict network protocols and destinations. Refuse overwrites by default during development, write to a new path, and keep the original until the output is independently verified.

A syntax check, successful process exit, valid container, or local playback test proves only that layer. Acceptance should match the real boundary: target player, editor, streaming receiver, archival standard, or API consumer.

## Advanced learning resources

Use the official filter, codec, format, protocol, utility, scaler, and resampler manuals as the reference corpus. Use `slhck/ffmpeg-encoding-course` for a structured intermediate bridge, `amiaopensource/ffmprovisr` for preservation-oriented practice, and the NVIDIA guide for a vendor-specific hardware path. The official Trac wiki is useful but was inaccessible during this research pass, so its examples remain leads rather than verified evidence.
